MarkLogic XQuery framework (mx)
-------------------------------

MX is designed to provide a 'starting point' for developing MarkLogic XQuery web applications.



Website
-------

Up-to-date documentation and source code can always be obtained from the MX github repo

https://github.com/xquery/mx


Dependency
----------
MarkLogic server is required, please refer to MarkLogic excellent documentation for getting 
the server installed and initializing a database and related HTTP application server.

MX uses xproc (Norman Walsh XMLCalabash) as build tool, in addition to providing a 


Installation - For the impatient
--------------------------------

setup mydatabase (database and http server) on port 9000 

run bin/mx-generate -p 9000 -d mydatabase -r /var/myapp/xquery

change root directory for MarkLogic http server to /var/myapp/xquery

test installation by browsing to http://localhost:9000/mx


Installation
-------------

You need to first ensure you have a MarkLogic database and application server
available 



Once you have a working MarkLogic HTTP application server running then there are 2 options 
for getting started with MX.


I) Generate starter application (requires Java dependency)
   
   run bin/mx-generate -p http port -d database name -r root directory

   The following example will generate a skeleton distribution in the /var/application/src/xquery/directory

   ex.  bin/mx-generate -r /var/application/src/xquery/


II) Manual installation

    Copy app.xml and fx-controller.xqy to root HTTP application server directory. 

    Copy fx.xqm to directory named 'lib' under root HTTP application server


However way you installed it you should now test to see if all is working properly

    ex. http://localhost:9000/mx

Once you start developing with MX you will discover that documenting your interfaces become easier

at capturing how MX was developed.

Many of the principles embedded in MX were inspired by active/passive observation of some of 
my MarkLogic colleagues;

Though clearly I take all the blame for anything incorrect, broken or plain stupid I did 
find it useful to be able to pick over previously written code and take (what I thought) 
was most appropriate.
